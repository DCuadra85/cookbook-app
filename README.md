# cookbook-app

Daniel what's up dude, it's 3 am ivan writing here. 

# before you run any code read this first

# I appiligize in advance for how much reading this is haha

# What I've finished so far. 

So I was able to make a skeleton front end for us, made most of the routes we need atleast to test and start out, created models, and I have written comments in every page to explain what is going on. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out but I wrote them just to be clear and all. 

# The index.js error

So if you run code right now it will error out. 
I figured out the problem but haven't found an answer.

- any time I add a new file to the model's folder it doesn't like it and it will tell you that there is an error in the index.js file. 

- this means that the error is not within the ingridients.js or the recipie.js, because before I wrote a line of code in eiter of the two files it would send the same error. 

- So therefor in order to run any code, remove the ingridients.js and the recipie.js file's out of that models directory BUT DON'T DELETE THEM, because those are actually good skeleton models for the project, feel free to edit them in any way you want though! But they look good to me haha

- if you find the solution to this before I do then amazing! but if not no worries I'll spend more time tomorrow working on it, im just about to die if I stay up any longer 

# config file

So for now just run workbench on your local server to mess with it if you want, I can help deploy it to heroku and jawsdb later! 

# ONCE runniing code what this app will actually do. 

You will see that I have made but to explain it more. 

- The user will be presented with a login page. 
- Once Once logged in, they will be presented with a members page with a button and a nav bar. 
- Once the user clicks, Add new recipie, then they will be presented with an ingridients container
- once they are done they can click the done button
- they will be presented with a container that gives them an option to add a new recipie or view all their recipies
- if they click view all recipies, they will be sent to the 'viewAll.html" which has all of the their recipies (and if we get to it we can have other user's recipies displayed. 
- We can add delete buttons to all the recipies for the option to "destroy" that recipie


# Summary 
over all this is just a recipie book made by the user, that reaches all the requirements for the project. Hopefully we can still get an a haha. 

anyways good work, and I'll see you tomorrow and help out as much as I can with this. 

# The repo
clone it and if you want start the branching process
